## Description

The Dog Adoption application is designed to allow users to view listings and apply to adopt dogs online. Additionally, users can login and register to the application. Once logged in, users may also add new adoption listings. Users may approve or reject applicants of listings they own.

## Installation

This repo depends on the [dog-db-server](https://github.com/iatenine/dog-db-server) app running locally with a properly configured application.properties file to connect to a properly structured PostGreSQL database. Please download both repos and start the server before running the client app

## Running
Once server is running, this app can be run by simply opening index.html in a browser
